# Microservices Architecture with Service Registry

This repository demonstrates the development of a microservices-based system with a **Service Registry** for service registration and discovery, implemented using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Eureka.

---

## **Project Overview**

### Objective
To build a scalable and robust microservices architecture featuring a **Service Registry** for managing and discovering microservices efficiently.

### Key Features
- Centralized Service Registry using **Eureka Server**.
- RESTful communication between multiple microservices.
- Support for scalability and fault tolerance.

---

## **System Architecture**

### Components

1. **Service Registry**
   - Built with Spring Cloud Eureka.
   - Central repository for microservices registration and discovery.

2. **Microservices**
   - **User Service:** Handles user-related operations.
   - **Order Service:** Manages order-related workflows.
   - **Payment Service:** Processes payments and maintains transaction records.

3. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - RESTful APIs for communication between services.
   - Eureka Server for service location transparency.

---

## **Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Frameworks:** 
  - Spring Boot (microservices development)
  - Spring Cloud (Eureka integration)
- **Build Tool:** Maven/Gradle
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Testing Tools:** JUnit, MockMVC
- **API Testing:** Postman

---

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Java 8+**.
2. Install **Maven** or **Gradle**.
3. Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL).

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/microservices-service-registry.git
cd microservices-service-registry
```

### Start Eureka Server

1. Navigate to the `eureka-server` directory.
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Access the Eureka dashboard at `http://localhost:8761`.

### Start Microservices

1. Navigate to each service directory (e.g., `user-service`, `order-service`, `payment-service`).
2. Run each service:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Verify that services are registered with Eureka by checking the Eureka dashboard.

## **Project Workflow**

### Step 1: Setup Eureka Server
- Create a Spring Boot project with Eureka Server dependencies.
- Enable Eureka Server using `@EnableEurekaServer`.

### Step 2: Develop Microservices
- Create individual microservices with Eureka Client dependencies.
- Register microservices with the Eureka Server.

### Step 3: Implement REST Endpoints
- Define REST APIs for each microservice.
- Use Eureka for service discovery during inter-service communication.

### Step 4: Testing
- **Unit Testing:** Test individual components.
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between services.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Validate the complete workflow.

## **Advanced Features (Optional)**

1. **Load Balancing:**
   - Use Spring Cloud LoadBalancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

2. **API Gateway:**
   - Implement Spring Cloud Gateway for centralized request routing.

3. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - Use Resilience4j or Hystrix for circuit-breaking and fault resilience.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and metrics visualization.
